This is a work in progress.  My goal is to create a GAN for speech to text and text to speech.  (Goal is better speech recognition with less training data, and creating human like speech from text)  
Outlined Steps:
	1.  Understand how sound waves are numerically represented, pratice loading into Python (Current)
	2.  Format Sound waves, so can input into an ANN
	3.  Build a Speech to Text model
	4.  Build a Text to Speech model
	5.  Build a GAN for image reconstruction (what I have seen them used for)
	6.  Combine 2 architectures together in such a way to construct a GAN
	7.  Find data to train on, train if data exists
